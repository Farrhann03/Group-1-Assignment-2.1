# GIT & CLI: Assignment

## Brief

This is a research assignment where students will be given time for research and put into group for discussion.

Version control tools are plenty and have wide range of practices. This research assignment aims to help learners expand their choice of version control tools (Part 1) and being acquainted with the branching strategies best practices in the industry (Part 2).

[Reference Link](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/version-control-software/) or search online with key word "Version Control Tool".

Discussion Points:

1. What are the version control tools used in the industry?

- Git
- CVS
- SVN
- Mercurial
- Monotone
- Bazaar
- TFS
- VSTS
- Perforce Helix Core
- IBM Rational ClearCase
- Revision Control System
- Visual SourceSafe (VSS)
- CA Harvest Software Change Manager
- PVCS
- darcs

1. Why are they being used?

- Version control is important to keep track of changes — and keep every team member working on the right version. You should use version control software for all code, files, and assets that multiple team members will collaborate on.

It needs to do more than just manage and track files.

### Part 2

- Yvonne
- Amy 
- Daniel
- Farhan

Discussion Points:

1. How many branching strategies are there? What are they?

- Master // Main
- Feature branch // Topic branch
- Release branch
- Hotfix branch
- Develop branch // Integration branch

- A way for a team to write, merge and ship code in the context of a version control system for example like Git.

1. Which branching strategy looks the most practical for you personally?

- Git seems the most practical in terms of managing and adding codes with other team members or people and is integrated to github itself which makes it easy to manage the main file itself.

1. Consider the following scenarios, recommend a branching strategy suitable for the scenario, and explain why?
   a. Startup with less than 5 developers
   b. Startup with multiple small team of developers (3 teams of 3 developers)
   c. Startup with no specific team make up. It’s just a group of 8 developers.
   d. SME with multiple small team of developers (4 teams of 3 developers)
   e. MNC & Banking with multiple large team of developers (10 teams of 12 developers)
